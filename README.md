=========

Test code for libev 

[*libev*](http://software.schmorp.de/pkg/libev.html) is a full-featured and high-performance event loop that is loosely modelled after libevent.  
Full document is [here](http://pod.tst.eu/http://cvs.schmorp.de/libev/ev.pod).
You can download from [here](http://dist.schmorp.de/libev/).


I tried to create this project on linux with Eclipse and CDT. And I excluded libev. D
